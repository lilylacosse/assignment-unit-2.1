    <p>See console for output.</p>

    <p>1. When concatenating in console.log, I know you can use a comma or a + sign, is it okay to mix a comma and + in one console.log "entry"? I was having a hard time getting the spacing to come out correctly with all commas in "My name is Lily LaCosse, and I think 11 is a winner!" and I wasn't sure why.</p>

    <p>2. I just want to confirm that 'else' does not get a specified conditional statment because it is the catch all at the end that takes care of all other data. Is this correct?</p>
